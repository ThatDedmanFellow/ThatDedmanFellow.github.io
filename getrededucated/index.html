From improved study spaces to free hot water I’ve led a range of successful projects over the year, but there is still a great deal to be done to continue to make student life better, simpler and more enjoyable.

                        <h3>Student-centric study spaces</h3>
                        <p>Quality study spaces remain in high demand across our campuses, and so I’d push for increased access for both undergraduates and postgraduates to spaces designed with input from students. I’d also develop the Union’s own facilities, providing well-equipped spaces in a less formal environment. </p>

                        <h3>A digital campus</h3>
                        <p>I’d lobby the University to expand scale and scope of digital resources provided. From recorded lectures to specialist software, this will help ease demand for physical spaces whilst also improving accessibility to resources both on and off our campuses.</p>

                        <p>Pressure on student finances is high, so I’d challenge the University on the value-for-money and experience they provide when printing. I’d aim to launch a free Union-led printing offer, which even in a limited form would finally deliver on a long-standing student request.</p>

                        <p>Considering the University Restructure, I’d seize this opportunity to develop our Academic Rep structure. I’d devise new roles where appropriate to ensure comprehensive representation, working with the reps to increase their visibility and ability to collect feedback from all students. </p>

                        <p>I’d emphasise to the University the need to consult widely with their student body, using Student Forums to give students the chance to directly contribute to the future direction of the institution. I’d also work with the Sabbatical Team to push for a student presence on the University Remuneration Committee which decides executive pay. </p>

I’d revisit the idea of a Union reward scheme, literally putting our money where our mouth is when rewarding our volunteers.</p>
