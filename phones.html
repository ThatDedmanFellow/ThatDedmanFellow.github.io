                <h2>Hello there!</h2>
                <p>I quite often get asked for my opinion on what phones people should buy, and have often thought about placing all of the information in a single place. This website represents that attempt, and also allows me to hone my HTML skills at the same time.</p>
                <p>In terms of retailers I tend to recommend either <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon UK</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/electricals/mobile-phones-accessories/c60000469">John Lewis</a></strong> purely for the stength of their warranties and customer service. John Lewis also has the advantage of being a physical retailer, so you can absolutely go and try before you buy.</p>

                <h2>Moto G7</h2>
                <p><strong>Released:</strong> February 2019 <br><strong>Price:</strong> £239.99 (April 2019)</p>
                <p>Motorola has always been strong in the upper budget/midrange sector, and the new G7 is no exception. Decent internals and a camera which has improved with each generation makes this a tempting proposition, but the 3000 mAh battery falls firmly in the middle of the park. The <strong>Moto G7 Plus (<a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/motorola/g7-plus.html">Carphone Warehouse, £269.99</a>)</strong> is worth a look for those looking for a bit more oomph, while the cheaper <strong>Moto G7 Power (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/motorola-6-2-Inch-Android-Sim-Free-Smartphone-Black/dp/B07N8LY9BS">Amazon UK, £179.99</a>)</strong> comes packing an impressive 5000 mAh battery which will get you through the day and then some.</p>

                <h2>Nokia 7.1</h2>
                <p><strong>Released:</strong> October 2018 <br><strong>Price:</strong> £189.00 (April 2019)</p>
                <p>Slightly older than the Moto G7, but I stand by it as being one of the best all-rounder phones currently on the market. A decent camera paired with good internals makes this an excellent value handset. This is also part of the Android One scheme, meaning that updates come fairly quickly from Google and Nokia. Since the Nokia is also slightly older it is also frequently on sale, so chances are you'll be able to pick it up at a decent price.</p>

                <h2>Huawei P20 Lite</h2>
                <p><strong>Released:</strong> October 2018 <br><strong>Price:</strong> £191.09 (March 2018)</p>
                <p>Huawei have made a real name for themselves as a company who produces handsets which represent fantastic value. It is a slightly older device than the Moto G7 and the Nokia 7.1, and while the specs are broadly similar there is one area where it wins - the camera. Huawei have a reputation for very strong cameras, and the P20 Lite takes the pedigree of the P20 and P20 Pro and makes it a whole lot more affordable. It will look visually different to the Android that people are used to, but is worth a look regardless!</p>

                <h2>Honor 10</h2>
                <p><strong>Released:</strong> May 2018 <br><strong>Price:</strong> £299.95 (March 2018)</p>
                <p>The Honor 10 is a really interesting one. Honor is the budget sub-brand of Huawei, and so in many senses this bears a number of similarities to the P20 line (including the P20 Lite mentioned above). This is, however, a true flagship unlike the others mentioned above. It is an older device, but for those looking for flagship-level performance on the cheap this is a good shout. A 3400 mAh battery goes alongside a fantastic camera, drawing upon AI technolgy to improve shots based on what is being taken. The <strong>Honor View 20 (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-storage-Camera-Display-Official-Sapphire-Blue/dp/B07MKY35D4">Amazon UK, £479.95</a>)</strong> is the slightly newer equivalent, which while a bit more expensive will guarantee you a slightly newer handset.</p>
